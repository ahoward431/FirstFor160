    <h1>Hello Austin</h1>
    <p>
      I think that all people should vaccinate their kids. I mean, you'd think that eradicating measles
      would've been good enough that vaccines are a good thing, but I guess not. I guess having another
      measles outbreak 50 years after we eradicated it is fine. It's fine. Fine.
